This is a project done with my teammate @Adrianna for the cognitive processes modelling 2 class at cognitive science studies at UW.
The aim of the project was to model a network of students studying master cognitive science at UW. More on the analysis and results in Wiki. 
Repository consists of code for large network and subnetwork, as well as images of analyses.
